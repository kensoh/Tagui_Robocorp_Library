# TagUI_Robocorp_Library
Library for TagUI and Robocorp integration

Hi all , this is the Tagui_Robocorp Library by which it is possible to write the tagui script using different languages in Robocorp Lab. 

Download the tagui_script.py and use in your robocorp workflow to use as a library. For a demonstration, robocorp workflow <b>Tagui_Robocorp.zip</b> is added in Github repository to get an idea of how to use it.

Also for getting idea about the tagui_robocorp library, here's a [YouTube video demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAfQpNZVbKI) and [LinkedIn announcement of Tagui_Robocorp library](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/nived-n-776470139_tagui-robocorp-library-activity-6786985096739213312-FLcU).


[Nived N] Will add detailed documentation of this library later.
